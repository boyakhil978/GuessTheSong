  prompt user to login with oauth
  save acess token

  present game options to user (how many rounds, random from global top songs or taste based from user(s))

  fetch list of songs based on game options

  play song clip and wait for user prompt to next round (use yt-dlp)

additional:
  async task to fetch songs while playing game with a buffer

  pin the game window on top to ensure that user does not see the song playing

Problems:
  music control through api only works with spotify premium , maybe fetch recomended songs from spotify and play on youtube? AdBlock?

  If the user doesnt have a big enough library the songs will eventually start to repeat.

  Get song titles and artist names from Spotify and play that into YouTube

(Need Spotify API and YouTube)
